# Graveyard manager - WIP
### About
It's an API server for a graveyard manager service, which allows to administer a cementery and search for graves on graveyards.

### What does the API allow to do?
- Create/modify a graveyard
- Add/modify/remove plots for graves
- Add/modify/remove graves from plots
- Add new people to graves
- Modify person data
- Pay for grave
- Search for people across all graveyards

### What is missing and would be nice to have
<sup>In other words, what will (hopefully) be added in the future</sup>
- Advanced search for people
- Support for columbaria
- Users and authentication
